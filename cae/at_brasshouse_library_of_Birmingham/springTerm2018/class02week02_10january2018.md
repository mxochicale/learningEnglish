1. Your class has attended a panel discussion on facilities which 
should receive money from local authorities. You have made the notes below.

Which facilities should receive money from local authorities?
* museums
* sports centres
* public gardens

Some opinions expressed in the discussion:
* "Museums aren't popular with everybody"
* "Sports centres mean healthier people"
* "A town needs green spaces - parks are great for everybody"

Write an essay discussion two of the facilities in your notes.
You should **explain which facility it is more important** for 
local authorities to give money to, **giving reasons** in support
of your answers.

You may, if you wish, make use of the opinions expressed in the discussion,
but you should use own words as far as possible.

## CANDIDATE A
Nowadays, many facilities could use money from local authorities. These are people who
claim that cultural institutions should receive money than other facilities. But which ones
should receive more investment is open to debate.
On the other hand, museums should be the institutions that need to receive a lot of money because people have lost the
interest in visiting and promoting them. In a world where true values are not respected as they should be, it is important 
to remember what really matters. Moreover, the young men should be aware of the importance of knowing the basic things in 
different domains. For example, science and history museums provide people very interesting informations. Therefore, in 
order to have well-informed teenagers the local authorities should give money to museums. With that money, it can be
organised events like the day of open museums.
On the other hand, green spaces also receive money from local authorities. Mainly because in big cities, where the
air is very polluted trees can absorb many of the gases produced leading to a much healthier environment. Furthermore,
there can be built spaces for kids to play and also running tracks for people who cannot afford to go to gym. It is
important for people to keep doing exercise in open air and in my opinion, parks are the best place.
All in all, as far as I am concerned the most important facility that should receive investment from local authority are
the museums.
## EXAMINERS CANDIDATE A
* CONTENT [Mark 5]. Commentary: All is relevant to the task and the target reader is fully informed. The candidate discusses two of the proposed
facilities (museums and parks), and chooses one of them (museums) to benefit from the extra funding. The candidate 
discusses the reasons why each one should receive the money: _science and history museums provide people very interesting
informations; in order to have well-informed teenagers, the local authorities should give money to museums; trees can absorb
many of the gases produced leading to a much healthier environment; running tracks for people who cannot afford to go to gym._
The final decision is made in the final paragraph.
* COMMUNICATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS [Mark 3]. Commentary: The conventions of essay writing are used well. There is a clear opening paragraph and a strong conclusion which leaves
no room for doubt as to where the money should go: _as far as I am concerned the most important facility that should 
recieve investment from local authority are the museums._ The register is consistently formal and the essay has an objective
tone, giving options and proving supporting statements with evidence. The clear paragraphing helps to hold the target
reader's attention and communicate both straightforward and more complex ideas in a logical manner.
* ORGANISATION [MARK 3] Commentary: The test is well organised and coherent, and uses a variety of cohesive devices to generally good effect. The ideas are
clearly introduced: _nowadays; on the other hand; moreover; for example; therefore; on the other hand; furthermore; all in all._ There
is a mix of long and short sentences, and some of the shorter ones could benefit from being combined. Organisational
patterns are evident in the choice of language. For example, in the first paragraph it is stated that _many facilities could use
money from local authorities._ This then narrows to become _cultural institutions should receive more money,_ and then the final
sentence uses substitution to set out the main idea: _But which ones should receive more investment is open to debate._
* LANGUAGE [MARK 2] Commentary: There is a range of relevant vocabulary, but this is not always used successfully to communicate full ideas.
Take for example _In a world where ture values are not respected as they should be, it is important to remember what really matters._
Although this has an appropriate tone and is accurate, it has little relevance to the text as a whole and adds no extra
information. A range of simple and some more complex grammatical structures is used with control. However, there are
a few word order and pronoun problems, such as _it can be organised events' there can be built._ There are also errors with
plurals and articles, but these do not impede communication: _the most important facility ... are the museums, afford to go to
gym, exercise in open air._

## CANDIDATE B
FACILITIES IN NEED OF FUNDS
Having listened to today's radio programme about facilities that need financial help, I realised that 
sports centers and public gardens have been negleted over the years by the local authorities.

There are few sports centers out there that meet the right characteristics that a good sports center 
must have. This is one of the many reasons that people avoid sport. We see lots of kids nowadays
suffering from obesity and other health problems caused by the simple fact that they don't do sport.

Another reason for this is that people nowhere to go out for a walk or to run in a nice place. 
Public gardens, parks for example are also lacking in numbers. The ones that are already there are 
not very nice and they don't have look very good.

I think that by improving this two facilities the population can benefit from this. By creating 
more sports centers, there will be some more jobs offered, and some kids might even follow a 
sports career. By making more public gardens people can get out more often and spend some good
quality time relaxing.

I think that local authorities should invest money in both facilities because, this is a good way
to increase the populations health.


## EXAMINERS CANDIDATE B
* CONTENT [Mark 3] COMMENTARY:   
All content is relevant to the task and the target is on the whole informed. The candidate has not
made a final selection between the two facilities. However, he makes a relevant choice (namely to 
fund both facilities), and justifies this decision with evidence throughout the essay: 
_This is one of the many reasons that people avoid sport... Another reason for this is that
people have nowhere_

* COMMUNICATIVE ACHIEVEMENT [Mark 4] COMMENTARY:  
The conventions of essay writing are evident and the target reader's attention is held throughout.
The opening statement sets up the context of the essay, and the candidate chooses two of the facilities
to discuss (parks, and sport centres). The candidate links these two aspects throughout the essay, and
this linking is effective in communicating more complex ideas which relate to both facilities.
For example, _sports centers and public gardens have been neglected over the years, people avoid
sport... another reason for this is that people have nowhere to go out for a walk._ The arguments
are backed up and supported with evidence either from experience or from the input text.
A consistent register is used, and the overall tone is suitably persuasive and objective.

* ORGANISATION [Mark 4] COMMENTARY:   
The text is well organised and coherent. Fairly subtle organisational patterns and cohesive devices 
are used, rather than over linking words: for example, relative clauses/pronouns, substitutions 
and ellipsis. For example, _Having listened to ... I realised that, We see lot of kids nowadays
suffering from obesity... caused by. Another reason for this is. The ones that are._
Some sentences are quite short and could have been connected to make the text more fluid at times:
_Public gardens, parks for example are also lacking in numbers. The ones ..._ 
but the overall effect is good.

* LANGUAGE [Mark 3] COMMENTARY:
There is a range of vocabulary and some lexis, which is collocated appropriately:
_neglected over the years; suffering from obesity; the simple fact that; lacking in numbers;
follow a sports career, quality time._ There is also a range of simple and more complex
grammatical structures used with control. Although there is slight awkwardness in places
and a few errors, these do not cause the reader difficulty:
_that meet the right characteristics that a good sports center must have._


## CANDIDATE C
In regard of a recent discussion about the facilities, which are financially supported by local
authorities, I would like to write a few of my personal thoughts. Whether we are talking about 
sport centres or public gardens, there is no doubt that they are both a good thing to have in
the city and should both be supported somehow. The only question then is which one of these 
is more important, what are the pros and cons of each one?

Let me start with the sport centres as I think these are a bit more problematic. Obviously,
in our times where lots of people spend days sitting in their office staring at a computer,
some sort of physical training is very important. We have to balance that shift in our lifestyles.
The problem I see with supporting the sports centres is the number of activities that you can do
at these days. There is almost countless list of either individual or team sports that we can think of,
and each centre is usually designed for a specific type or at least a group of sports similar in
its nature. Therefore I think that it is too difficult to support them equally and we can't say which
activity is better than the others either. Another reason for not financing sports as much as green
parks is their commercial use. What I mean by that is that we usually pay for everything the centre 
offers us to do and therefore they are more able to last from their own money than gardens.

Regarding of the green spaces, the situation is much clearer I think. Every city needs gardens where 
people can sit and relax, but nobody is going to pay a tax for just walking around.

These factors lead me to my conclusion, that the public gardens are definitely a facility which 
should be financed from public money, whereas in the case of sports centres the situation is 
questionable.
  

## EXAMINERS CANDIDATE C

* CONTENT [Mark 5] COMMENTARY:
All content is relevant to the task and the target reader would be fully informed. The candidate 
discussed two of the options (sports centres and green spaces). Although the essay is slightly 
unbalanced, focusing mainly on sports centres, this is justified in the essay:
_Let me start with the sport centres as I think these are a bit more problematic._ Likewise,
the brief treatment of parks is explained, and what follows is enough to inform the reader fully:
_Regarding of the green spaces, the situation is much clearer._

* COMMUNICATIVE ACHIEVEMENTS [Mark 4] COMMENTARY:
The conventions of the communicative task are used effectively holding the target reader's attention
with ease. The register and tone are consistent and the language choices are sufficient formal and 
appropriate throughout, particularly the opening and closing paragraphs, _The only question then is 
which one of these is more important, what are the pros and cons of each one?; These factors
lead me to my conclusion._ There is lots of personal opinion, rather than objective opinion 
based on a generally assumed view: _I would like to write a few of my personal thoughts; I think these
are; The problem I see,_ but straightforward and more complex ideas are nevertheless communicated.
A more objective approach would have been more suited to this essay task, which is to discuss the 
idea in general terms rather than in the candidate's own experience.

* ORGANISATION [Mark 4] COMMENTARY:
The essay is well organised and coherent, and the different ideas are clearly signposted throughout:
_Let me start with; Therefore; Another reason; Regarding._ The target reader can easily follow 
the argument. The paragraphs are internally well constructed, and are linked together appropriately. 
In terms of organisation patterns, the overall effect is generally good, rather than good throughout,
due to the imbalance of length between the second and the third paragraphs.

* LANGUAGE [Mark 4] COMMENTARY:
A range of vocabulary, including less common lexis, is used effectively, although not always precisely:
_we have to balance that shift in our lifestyles._ A wide range of simple and complex grammatical forms
is used with control and flexibility, particularly in terms of sentence construction: _Obviously, in our
times whre lots of people spend days sitting in their office staring at a computer, some sort of physical
training is very important._ Although there are occasional errors, these are often slips and do not
impede communication: _you can do at these days; there is almost countless list._
