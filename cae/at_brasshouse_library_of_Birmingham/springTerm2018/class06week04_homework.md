Motivating Children to do regular exercise

Undoubtedly, doing exercise is rather crucial these days where technological advances
where faster and cheaper internet and low-cost mobiles phones are more accessible for
everyone. Such is the worry for parents whom certainly want to educate their next generation 
not only as healthy as possible but with good  manners. With that in mind, 
the current debate for parents to motive their children to exercise regularly lays down 
between the increase of funding for governments for sport facilities or the improvement 
of parental example.

It is generally believed that if sports were cheaper, more people would use them.
Such premise is certainly truth to a degree that people would be more persuaded 
to exercise regularly, specially for children whom might be more motivated 
to take part on ludic activities that improve their physical health. 
That is one of many reasons for which government is being encouraged to increase 
the funding for building sport centres with accessible prices for people of all ages.
Nonetheless, I personally believe that, parental example is more important to tackle 
the problem from the root than the increase of governmental funding. 
Essentially, parents are the role models for their children and certainly for all 
manners and habits of children which are transmitted by example.
Parents, therefore, have a great deal of responsibility to educate their children,
for instance, to eat healthy, to exercise regularly, and to persuade their children 
to live a healthy life.

All in all, it is parents' responsibility to be the role models for their children
to exercise regularly as children in the future will pass better habits and manners 
to their next generation of human beings.
