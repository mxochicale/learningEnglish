Priorities for governments aiming to preserve cultural heritage

One particularly challenge for goverments is to provide the right amound of funding for
many priorities regarding education, health or cultural heritage. Particularly,
in this case we are mainly interested in discussion which of the following aspects 
can be prioritesed by goverments which can be either  the increase of funding for museums 
or the pedagogical aspects about the importance of cultural heritage in schools.

Generally, it is believe that education for children is a way to preserve any 
aspect of knowledge for future generation which might be obvious for schools to be taught 
the imporance of cultura heritage as part of their current curriculum. 
However, it can not be enteritely necessary as these days few childrens are less 
interested in their own culture.
Similarly, increase funding for museums is something that goes in hand to hand with 
the preserve of cultural heritage where usually new exibions require investents,
or the set up of new galleries or artist which is generally out of the budget for
small museums.

Personally speaking, I do believe that goverment should prioritise an increase 
of funding for museums as these are an excellent way to educate not only the children
but also the general public, making them more aware of the importance of the culture 
heritage. I also think that the increase of fuding for museums is a good investment
where the museum can create its own model of bussiness to make itself more sustainable 
for the creation of interesting exihitions of the public of all ages, bring new 
objects, or event create events where people can interact and learn more about its
own culture.
