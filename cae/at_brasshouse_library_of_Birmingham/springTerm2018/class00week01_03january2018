First day, Wednesday 3rd January 2018
---

I was so exited to start my first class that I arrived 10 minutes earlier, 17:35, but 
unfortunately nobody showed up, not even the teacher, which immediately made me too 
furious about the quality of the service of the brass house school. 
So, I went to the desk to ask what the heck what was happening and the receptionist 
called someone to provide my student's details so as to receive instructions about the 
re-assignation of my course which, as she  she highlighted, such changed had been 
notified to all the students by email, which was not truth since I got anything in 
my email related to this change.
Anyway, I went to new course which is the Cambridge Proficiency in English course
which is only on Wednesdays for three hours and this course has already started on 
the winter 2017 and it is a continuation for the spring term.


# SUMMARY 

The class consists of reviewing the exercises of inversion, some completion 
exercises, reading and some small conversation in groups of two persons.

## GRAMMAR 

### INVERSION 
Generally speaking, this expression with inversion are used in complains.
These are some examples:

control of her life again.

* So devastated _was she_ at the loss of her dog that 
John couldn't leave her alone.
* Only _Howard was_ aware of how serious Caroline's condition was.
* On no condition _should you_ take those pills without 
consulting a doctor
* Rarely _had she_ been shown such kindness by a total stranger.

so much that I decided to become an instructor.

## READING 


### My digital detox
Spending a weekend without access to communications technology was an eye-opener.

We were brushing through wet grass in the early morning when we
saw it -- a flash of white drifting behind a small patch of trees, backlit
by the sun. *Crouching* down next to Artley, our twenty-one-month-old son, 
my partner Will and I watched the unmistakable shape of a barn 
owl until it disappeared into the wood. The look on Artley's face was
part of a brief moment of magic, the kind of memory that we life for.
Ordinarily, my next thought would have been to pull out my phone,
take a phone or video and send a message. Connecting is something
I do unconsciously now, and sharing such moments has become
second nature.

F. The meaningful and the *mundane* have thus merged into one, all
dutifully and habitually recorded -- my enjoyment split between that
technological *impulse* and the more delicate human need to be in 
the moment. This is how we live these days.

That weekend, however, the three of us were, by our own choice,
offline. We were camping at a rural site called Swallowtail Hill in 
southern England, which offers visitors the option of leaving all their
electronic devices in the safe keeping of the owner for the duration of
their stay -- a kind of digital detox, you might say. We had been inspired
by William Powers' book Hamlet's BlackBerry, an imaginative and 
thoughtful work that explores reactions to new technologies throughout 
history and the lessons we should have learnt from them. *Blessed*
with two days of good weather and some delicious local food, I barely
noticed I wasn't offline.

G. What did strike me though was the change in Will's behaviour. If
my worst habit is incessant messaging, his is allowing his phone
to *take precedence* over everything else. Country walks, dinner,
bathing our son -- no moment is safe from the seemingly irresistible
ringing, vibrating, nagging phone, that demands -- and wins -- his
attention when he should be enjoying the moment with us.

I take equal responsibility for our digital obsession -- magnetically
drawn, as I am, to any screen that can feed my addiction. Nonetheless,
any objections of mine to this specific vice are usually swiftly defended
by an explanation of the importance of dealing with whatever it is
now, though it never seems anything that couldn't wait half and hour.
Suddenly, however, we had his full attention -- well almost. There
was a moment when he was distracted by a buzzing sensation and 
automatically reached for his phone, before realising it was a bee.

B. In truth, he wasn't alone in such lapses. Without our hand-held devices,
neither of us had much idea what time was. Then, I reached for
mine when I wondered about local shopping facilities and whether it 
is normal to see a barn owl during the day. And the magical moment
when Artley was being read his bedtime story in front of an open fire,
I've had to try and commit to my own *fallible* memory.

By breaking away from my connected life, however, I came to appreciate
just how much it had *permeated* my way of being. So-called 'early adopters',
the heavy technology users who throw themselves at every new device and
service, will admit to an uncontrollable *impulse* to check their emails accounts
or social networking sites. Researchers have called this 'variable interval
*reinforcement* schedule. Such people have in effect been drawn into digital-
message addiction because the most exciting rewards are unpredictable. 

H. What's more, the hustle they develop as they struggle to keep up with 
the pace of all that incoming information has produced a restless,
anxious way of engaging with the world. Desperate for efficiency, this 
seeps into people's physical lives. Perhaps that's why I feel compelled 
to tidy while on the phone, to fold the washing while brushing my 
teeth, and no single job has my undivided attention. 

A study by the University of California concluded that such constant 
multi-tasking gradually *erodes* short-term memory. It also discovered that
interruptions to any tasks requiring concentration are a massive problem, as
it takes us much longer to get back into them than it does to deal with the
interruption itself.

C. For those of us compelled to check email every few minutes, that
finding accounts for those days which seem to pass so quickly with 
so little getting done. And this is part of a wider trend. 'The more
we connect, the more our thoughts lean outward,' Powers writes.
'There's a preoccupation with what's going on "out there" in the 
bustling otherworld, rather than "in here" with yourself and those
around you.'

In other words, what was once exterior and faraway is now easily accessible 
and this carries a sense of obligation or duty. He sees the feeling that we
should be reaching out, or be available to be reached out to as tied to the self-
affirmation that the internet, and all that goes with it, provide us with.

D. Like me, he is true believer in the value and potential of digital
technologies. He concludes, however, that we need to find the discipline 
to restore control by reintroducing a little disconnectedness. 
 
One practical suggestion, for example, is to use paper as a more efficient way
of organising our thoughts. The theory of 'embodied interaction' asserts that
physical objects free our minds to think because our hands and fingers can do 
much of the work, unlike screens where our brains are constantly in demand.

E. More radical still is the idea of banning the internet at weekends on 
the grounds that being away from it on a regular basis allows us to
grasp its utility and value more fully. Hopefully, it also brings about 
a shift to a slower, less restless way of thinking, where you can just
be in one place, doing one particular thing, and enjoy it.

As we left Swallowtail Hill, we seemed to have achieved that. The real work
was just starting, however, trying to put this and other ideas into regular
practice in an attempt to balance work and home life. Powers also talks about 
'vanishing family trick', where a seemingly sociable family gradually dissolves
away to screens in different corners of the house. It's clearly a situation to be
avoided. Our digital detox had been something of a wake-up call. And guess
what? When the owner handed back our phones, we didn't have a missed cal or 
message between us.
