One of the requirements to take the preparation for Certificate in Advance English 
is take an enrollment test which consist of three parts: grammar test, writing test
 and a small evaluation of speaking skills.

Even thought I have been using English for three years, my grammar skills have not
evolved quite a lot since then and the reason to say that is because the results 
for my grammar test pointed out that my level is intermediate. 
Honestly, I felt too disappointed, but that is the truth according to that test.

On the other hand, the writing and speaking tests were fine. I did write a small
essay about how computers are affecting positively and negatively to our 
today's society and the teacher impression were "you writing is good" and I receive 
no comments about my speaking test. 

With that in mind, and as I planned, I have been enrolled to the course of
 preparation to Cambridge advance English course which start next day
Wednesday the 3rd of January 2018.
