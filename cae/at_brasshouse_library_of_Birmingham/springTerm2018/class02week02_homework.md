# Extra Reading 
In the EletrocoLyte Issue29-Nov/Dec17, I read a very complex text regarding the newest 
release of star wars series. I would like to transcribed it and make some notes with 
regard to the used vocabulary.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi
Director: Rian Johnson
Starring: Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver
Running time: 150 mins


Space operas don't exactly lend themselves to subtlety.
When The Force Awakens ended with its main character left handing, 
all while standing on a cliff to boot, the message was as emphatic as a hug
from a Wookie -- get ready for the sequel.
The Last Jedi picks up directly where its predecessor left off, 
with scavenger-turned-saviour Rey (Daisy Ridley) returning a **lightsabre**
to its former owner, Luke Skywalkey (Mark Hamill).
**Grizzled** and **beardy**, Luke doesn't seem keen on new friends.
But will he train her?
Are they maybe realted?
Will they get off this rock?
And what about R2D2 and Chewie -- do they just kick back with some
**blue milk** while Rey and Luke get mystical?

As ever with Star Wars, details are scarce.
That said, the trailers have spilled some major beans, not least of which
is the fate of Carrie Fisher's character, General Organa -- 
seemingly **blown out** of space by her Vader loving son Kylo Ren (Adam Driver).
Add to that Luke getting **bug eyed** with fright at Rey's immense Force power
(convinced, even, that it's time for the Jedi to end altogether),
things are looking **bleak** for the **plucky** Resistence's fight against the First Order.

Ex-Stormtrooper Finn (John Boyega) for one is going undercover with fellow 
rebel Rose (Kelly Marie Tran), while X-wing pilot Poe (Oscar Isaac) is unshaved and 
determined, and thus, we can assume, set for some second-film-in-the-trilogy peril.

For as the general downbeat vibe implies, The Last Jedi faces the same task as 
The Empire Strikes Back once did -- that of maturing the established mythos into
**murkier**, more complicated territory.
Within reason, of course.
The presence of 'porgs' -- new birdlike creatures that some of our heroes
seem to have adopted as pets -- is a reminder that this is the same 
franchise that gave us Ewoks and the galaxy's **prissiest** robot **butler**.

Director Rian Jonhson, who also wrote the screenplay, has been predictably **coy** about the plot.
But his work on Looper, not to mention some of Breaking Bad's episodes, implies that
he won't hesitate to push the story into new, surprising places.

Because as fun as The Force Awakens was, professional remixer J.J. Abrams didn't do much more
than slap a shiny face of paint on old **motifs**. 
For The Last Jedi to truly deliver, it needs to aggravate fans as much as it pleases them.

Some fresh faces -- Laura Dern and Benicio del Toro in particular -- should help with that.
As should the prospect of Rey potentially teaming up with Kylo, thereby scrambling everything
we've come to know from this saga in terms of Good vs Evil.
